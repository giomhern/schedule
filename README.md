# User Experience 

The user experience is intended to be simple and easy to follow for novice technology users. To access the `\admin` route, users have to first create an account, and proceed to login as redirected upon successful creation. They are then allowed full access to create events that appear in the shared database. A simplified user flow is demonstrated below.

1. New users are linked to login. 
2. If you don't have an account, you are prompted to create one and can navigate to the sign up page by clicking on `Sign Up` at the bottom of the form. 
3. You can create an account by submitting your name, an email address, and a password. 
4. Once your account is successfully created, you are redirected to the login page to login. 
5. Once logged in, you are free to create events for your organization.
